- Figure out how to expand canvas to size of its parent (shouldn't have to explicitly set width/height on canvas)
- Need arrow icons for shift and del
- Logic for CanvasButton._draw_button() should not use the bounding box of the text when absolute with and height
    are specified. Because the bounding box will vary depending upon the text. Should use the centre point instead.
- Installer for Mac/Windows/Linux?
- Message vertical alignment/centering in dialog doesn't work so well. Review this logic.
- May need special indicator for final 9 bonus puzzles (currently part of level 3)?
- Hide mouse cursor (when screensize is raspberry pi)  -- check
- Full screen when on raspberry pi (platform specific setting)  -- check
- Iconise all buttons
- Create highscore page
- Tweak screen init signature: master should not have a default and should be first in arg list
- Fix mouse cursor on raspberry pi popups
- Fix undo button not properly disabling
