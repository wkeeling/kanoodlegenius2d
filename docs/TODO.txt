- Explore whether from playhouse.test_utils import test_database could also support being a decorator - both at the
function and class level
- Figure out how to expand canvas to size of its parent (shouldn't have to explicitly set width/height on canvas)
- Change "onclick" references to "onpress"
- Need arrow icons for shift and del
- Fix width of buttons on select player and dialog box. Put cancel next to OK on dialog
- Timing of noodle fade in does not work when more than 4 noodles on board.
- Disable noodle controls until noodle available (and next/prev when only one noodle). Needs a disable() method
    on CanvasButton
- Game.resume() and board completed callback both need to start a new board. Create helper method if necessary.
- Logic for CanvasButton._draw_button() should not use the bounding box of the text when absolute with and height
    are specified. Because the bounding box will vary depending upon the text. Should use the centre point instead.

- Dialog congratulations should have title
- Have a settings.show_board_numbers for debug purposes
