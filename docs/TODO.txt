- Add tests for individual model methods that are coming into existence
    - Puzzle.place()
    - Board.setup()
    - Board.place()  (subtly different to Puzzle.place() as this is called by the player, and so will need to validate
        that the board can accommodate the noodle in its specified configuration)
- Perhaps move setup data code out of base.py
- Explore whether from playhouse.test_utils import test_database could also support being a decorator - both at the
function and class level
