- Explore whether from playhouse.test_utils import test_database could also support being a decorator - both at the
function and class level
- CanvasButton API (a function, not class) should take just text and x,y position of text centre.
    Can figure out how to wrap in button rectangle.
    Button click highlight should fade
- Better buttons (make button class which is canvas based - can be reused)
    - Width, height, outline, background, text, position
    - Called "CanvasButton" or something
- Implement status bar
- Need to implement a dialog popup. This will be standalone and will be a parent of the overall game frame, with
    an absolute position. Used for puzzle complete, player name already in use etc.
