- Explore whether from playhouse.test_utils import test_database could also support being a decorator - both at the
function and class level
- Need to implement a dialog popup. This will be standalone and will be a parent of the overall game frame, with
    an absolute position. Used for puzzle complete, player name already in use etc.
- Figure out how to expand canvas to size of its parent (shouldn't have to explicitly set width/height on canvas)
- Display "Puzzles completed (n/total)" on player selection screen (not on game screen)
- May need to hold "completed" field on Board (already have "complete" property) as this will distinguish between
    puzzles completed and puzzles auto-solved. completed() and complete() would both exist and have subtly
    different meanings.
- Change "onclick" references to "onpress"
- Create a Player.puzzles_completed('name') helper method
- Need arrow icons for shift and del
- CanvasButton needs a disabled state (onclicks do nothing, and fill is grey with no highlight)
- Use Fade to fade paginations, and also typing on newplayer
