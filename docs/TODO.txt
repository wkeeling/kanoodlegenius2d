- Explore whether from playhouse.test_utils import test_database could also support being a decorator - both at the
function and class level
- Implement status bar
- Need to implement a dialog popup. This will be standalone and will be a parent of the overall game frame, with
    an absolute position. Used for puzzle complete, player name already in use etc.
- Figure out how to expand canvas to size of its parent (shouldn't have to explicitly set width/height on canvas)
- Have board holes animate when they first appear
- HAve noodles animate onto the board when first set up
