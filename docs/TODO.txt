- Explore whether from playhouse.test_utils import test_database could also support being a decorator - both at the
function and class level
- Figure out how to expand canvas to size of its parent (shouldn't have to explicitly set width/height on canvas)
- Display "Puzzles completed (n/total)" on player selection screen (not on game screen)
- May need to hold "completed" field on Board (already have "complete" property) as this will distinguish between
    puzzles completed and puzzles auto-solved. completed() and complete() would both exist and have subtly
    different meanings.
- Change "onclick" references to "onpress"
- Create a Player.puzzles_completed('name') helper method
- Need arrow icons for shift and del
- Fix width of buttons on select player and dialog box. Put cancel next to OK on dialog
- Timing of noodle fade in does not work when more than 4 noodles on board.
- Disable noodle controls until noodle available (and next/prev when only one noodle). Needs a disable() method
    on CanvasButton
- Undo should update the game last played
- Game.resume() and board completed callback both need to start a new board. Create helper method if necessary.
