- Explore whether from playhouse.test_utils import test_database could also support being a decorator - both at the
function and class level
- Figure out how to expand canvas to size of its parent (shouldn't have to explicitly set width/height on canvas)
- Change "onclick" references to "onpress"
- Need arrow icons for shift and del
- Logic for CanvasButton._draw_button() should not use the bounding box of the text when absolute with and height
    are specified. Because the bounding box will vary depending upon the text. Should use the centre point instead.
- Installer for Mac/Windows/Linux?
- Message vertical alignment/centering in dialog doesn't work so well. Review this logic.
- "You are a genius" message should only appear if all puzzles were completed without auto-solving
- When move to a new level, should have a "Congratulations, you have completed Level x". When complete just a puzzle,
    the message should instead show "Puzzle Completed!"
- May need special indicator for final 9 bonus puzzles (currently part of level 3)?
